# MCS Exam Note
Collated as I see fit. Should you be able to write tiny hieroglyphes, one can certainly cram more information into the 3-paper, 6-page limit. 

Does not come with a `latexmk` makefile (albeit I probably should...) -- I built the $\TeX$ with the help of vscode/codium's *LaTeX Workshop* extension.
